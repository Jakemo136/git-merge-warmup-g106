<About for="Jake">
wait. This isn't HTML.

function aboutMe = (name = Jake) => {}
  let dedz = 100
  for (let age = 34; age <= Math.ciel(Math.random()*200)); age++) {
    if (age < dedz) {
      echo "Birthday Spree! You are " + age + " years old!"
    } else if (age === dedz) {
      echo "Yor dedz! Poor " + name
    }
  }
}
Crap. Not javascript either.
